This is an annotated version of the script used to generate the rainbow polygon series on [Evan You's site.](http://evanyou.me/)

I was curious how the script worked because of how beautiful effect is, and I also wanted to learn about how HTML5 canvas elements work.

In summary, the algorithm works by repeating these steps:
1. Draw a line between two starting points
2. Generate a third point that is rand() pixels to the right of the first two points
3. Create a polygon from the 3 points
4. Use the 2 recent-most points in the series as the starting points for the next polygon in the series

Improvements and fork requests are welcome.
